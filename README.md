This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Example async App
This is a example react app, where multiple async responses are merged to the state and outputted.
This was programmed only for a timebox of 2 hours, so Browser Tests or fancy error handling is not included/tested.

It uses the jsonplaceholder api for: 

##### 1. Users API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/
##### 2. Comments API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=

It has a small filter to switch the ID, so the shown User and Comments are changed.

#### 2. npm start
